<h3>The Lamborghini Huracánis a sports car manufactured by Italian automotive manufacturer Lamborghini replacing the previous V10 offering, the Gallardo.
The Huracán was revealed online in December 2013,making its worldwide debut at the 2014 Geneva Auto Show,and was released in the market in the second quarter of 2014.</h3>
<h1>Engine</h1> 
<h3>The Huracán maintains the 5.2-litre naturally aspirated Audi/Lamborghini V10 engine with an additional 0.2 litres.
Compared to the Gallardo, 
tuned to generate a maximum power output of 449 kW (602 hp; 610 PS). 
To ensure its balance and performance, the car is mid-engined. 
The engine has both direct fuel injection and multi-point fuel injection. 
It combines the benefits of both of these systems; it is the first time this combination is used in a V10 engine. 
To increase its efficiency, the Huracán's engine also includes a start-stop system.[citation needed] 
The firing order of the engine is 1, 6, 5, 10, 2, 7, 3, 8, 4, 9. This is printed on a metal plate on the top of the engine, as with all other Lamborghini models.
